# What is Pydantic?

Pydantic is a data validation library for python that allows users to define data models and schemas using Python type annotations. 
It provides a way to validate and parse data, ensuring that it conforms to the specified types and constraints. Pydantic is particularly useful for applications that require strict data validation, such as web APIs, configuration management, and data processing pipelines.

Pydantic is written in Rust which makes it super fast and efficient. 

## Top Features 
- **Data Validation**: Automatically validates data against defined types and constraints.
- **Type Annotations**: Uses Python type hints to define data models, making it easy to understand and integrate with IDEs.
- **Serialization/Deserialization**: Easily convert data to and from JSON, dictionaries, and other formats.
- **Strict vs Lax**: Pydantic offers both strict and lax modes for validation, allowing for more flexibility in handling input data.
- **Dataclasses Support**: Pydantic supports validation and parsing for Python dataclasses, making it easy to integrate with existing codebases.
- **Custom Validators/Serializers**: Allows users to define custom validation and serialization logic for complex data types.
